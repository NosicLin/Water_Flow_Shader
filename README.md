# Water_Flow_Shader
#StayatHome #YomequedoenCasa

While everyone is stuck at home (including me) I've got created FREE project files for you to play with in your games workflows or whatever.

I've used this shader in a few projects, the scene shows in the video is from Barbie Explore AR-VR mobile app I worked a few months ago.

The project in this GIT was created in UNITY3D (2018.3.7f1) to show how the flow map is used to recreate a awesome flowing water wiht some basics steps. 

The project content :

  째 Alpha CG unlit shader with basic Flow and Matcap
  째 LWRP HLSL unlit shader with basic Flow and Matcap
  째 Texture and Matcap used in the GIF example
  째 Materials with the example values
  
So, feel free to use the code, modify it, optimize it, break it, do whatever you want; I hope this could be usefull for anyone is trying to recreate a such amazing effect in this darkest time working from home. You can share with me what have you done, I will be very happy to see your works!

Enjoy and stay safe!
